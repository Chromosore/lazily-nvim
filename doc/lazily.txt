1. Introduction					*lazily*

	Lazily is a standalone plugin lazy loader. It is meant to be used with
	lightweight plugin manager or even vim8 packages.

	Lazily handles setting up the lazy-loading triggers and removing them
	once a plugin is loaded or canceled. It also keeps track of the
	plugins that were loaded so as to load them only once.

lazily.packadd({package})			*lazily.packadd()*
